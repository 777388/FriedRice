!!!THIS IS FOR KEEPING YOUR OWN PATHWAYS, WHERE THE NSA DECIDED (COST > QUICKNESS) IN WHAT PATHWAYS YOU TAKE THROUGH THE INTERNET!!!

Usage: python3 FriedRice.py cia.gov [or any other domain for that mattter, but the intelligence centralizes there]

First be sure to download dependencies, you'll need GOLANG https://go.dev/dl/, as well as www.github.com/lc/gau

sudo apt install hellfire dnsutils

Next I want you to create a rootservers.txt File, do not copy rootserver ips from other people as each is designated their own rootservers which contain virtual servers, just put in your home address

0.0.0.0

127.0.0.1

dig +trace will then begin to collect IPs to put into rootservers.txt every time you run this program, so the more you use this the more variability of responses you will obtain. Each collection should give you variation on the file structure of what was obtained by GAU, with this methodology you should be able to gain access to what was meant for you no matter what virtual machine they have you set on in your browser.

Dig +trace will open up a starting pathway correlated to IPs on the rootservers.txt file, each ip on the list gets its own trace, Hellfire will then begin to open up pathways for spiders using the starting pathway and then GAU will collect the intel from there on the whole domain using sites such as waybackmachine and alienvault

With NSA's PRISM program, the routes taken for data collection are not often the quickest route, but rather the least Costly route. Path Cost is an important aspect of Artificial Intelligence, and according to the Special Operations Forces Guides on PRISM, they are directly correlated to control pathways used to manipulate current events into segmentations of the web that are designated for Electromagnetic Warfare. Using these Electromagnetic Warfare systems it is possible to control entire armies of people, but what they hold in most importance is "The Treasures found using these systems" being more important than the terrorists caught and stopped using them. Saddam Hussein being one of them.
